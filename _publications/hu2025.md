collection: publications
permalink: /publication/hu2025
excerpt: "To alleviate traffic congestion and reduce vehicle emissions, the use of hard shoulder running (HSR) has emerged as a sustainable and cost-effective active traffic management technology. However, optimizing the utilization of HSR remains a critical challenge for improving highway traffic congestion. To tackle this issue, the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient with spatio-temporal constraints (STC-MADDPG) algorithm based on multi-agent reinforcement learning is proposed in this paper. ... This comprehensive evaluation of the algorithm's effectiveness covers three key aspects: driving efficiency, driving safety, and environmental protection. The findings conclusively demonstrate the positive impact of the proposed algorithm on all three fronts."
