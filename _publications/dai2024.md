title: "Road network traffic flow prediction: A personalized federated learning method based on client reputation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/dai2024
excerpt: 'Accurate traffic flow prediction can provide effective decision-making support for traffic management, alleviate traffic congestion, and improve road traffic efficiency. Traffic flow data contains personal privacy information, such as vehicle trajectories, driving speed, etc. However, most existing research focuses on using all local data to jointly construct prediction models, facing data security and privacy issues. ... Finally, we validated the method on the License Plate Recognition (LPR) datasets collected in Changsha city, China. The experimental results indicate that the method can achieve good prediction performance and stability while protecting the privacy of all participants.'
