collection: publications
permalink: /publication/dai2024
excerpt: 'Accurate traffic flow prediction can provide effective decision-making support for traffic management, alleviate traffic congestion, and improve road traffic efficiency. Traffic flow data contains personal privacy information, such as vehicle trajectories, driving speed, etc. However, most existing research focuses on using all local data to jointly construct prediction models, facing data security and privacy issues. In response to these challenges, this paper presents a Personalized Federated Learning method based on Client Reputation for traffic flow prediction. This method avoids direct sharing of original data by performing model training and information aggregation locally, thereby better protecting user privacy. We initially constructed the foundational model by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GCNs) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) for federated learning. GCNs are capable of capturing the spatial relationships between nodes in a road network, thereby extracting the spatial features of traffic flow. On the other hand, GRUs has advantages at handling sequential data, effectively capturing the dynamic temporal characteristics of traffic flow. Consequently, by combining GCNs and GRUs, we are able to build a model that captures both the spatial and temporal features of traffic flow. Subsequently, we employed a federated learning framework to train the model. In the training process, we propose two evaluation algorithms to evaluate the reputation of all clients participating in federated learning. Then, different weights are customized for each client through a personalized algorithm based on the client's reputation to improve its personalization. Finally, we validated the method on the License Plate Recognition (LPR) datasets collected in Changsha city, China. The experimental results indicate that the method can achieve good prediction performance and stability while protecting the privacy of all participants.'
